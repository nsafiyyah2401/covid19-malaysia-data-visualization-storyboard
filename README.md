# Malaysia COVID-19 Data Visualization Storyboard 
Interactive Dashboard | Quantitative • Temporal • Geospatial • Text Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive data visualization storyboard that explores the COVID-19 situation in Malaysia using Power BI. It integrates multiple data types—including textual, temporal, demographic, and geospatial datasets—to uncover national trends, public health patterns, and clinical insights.

The dashboard supports SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and SDG 4 (Quality Education) by transforming complex pandemic data into educational, accessible visual narratives.
